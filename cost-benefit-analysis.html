<p><em>Spash on Dasgupta Review</em></p>
<p>Decades ago environmental CBA developed a range of methods for imputing monetary values, but
with limited applicability under specific conditions (Hanley &amp; Spash, 1993; Spash, 2005). For a
start, these methods only apply to marginal changes in environmental goods or services, not
least because the value of money itself (its marginal utility) alters when there are large changes
affecting income; also, economic welfare measures assume other things (e.g. all other prices) remain
the same which is violated by large changes. Clearly things like mass extinction of species and
human induced climate change are not small, marginal, changes.
Two approaches are employed by social CBA: revealed and stated preference methods. The first relies
upon existing markets that can be associated with environmental attributes (e.g. air pollution affecting
house prices) and so is severely restricted. The second uses surveys designed to illicit, primarily,
willingness-to-pay for environmental changes. Dasgupta attends to one stated preference approach: the
contingent valuation method (CVM). He claims that: ‘CVM is attractive because it appeals to our
democratic instinct, that people should be asked for their opinion on matters that may be of concern
to them’ (Dasgupta, 2021, p. 304). In addition, the CVM is promoted as widely applicable (unbounded
by existing markets) to revealing values for everything from aesthetics to biodiversity loss. The ability to
include a range of value categories contributing to an individual’s utility extends to including:
‘respondents’ sense of a species’ existence value—perhaps even its intrinsic value’ (Dasgupta, 2021, p. 304).
Normally environmental economists define a set of four values: direct use, option, existence and bequest
value. However, Dasgupta (Dasgupta, 2021, p. 301), for no apparent reason, claims a different set of
six sources of value for biodiversity that mix-up objects of value with types of values. While all his
examples are consequentialist and based on creating utility for humans, he confuses concepts of
existence value with sacred values, moral worth and intrinsic value. So let us turn to the value problems.</p>
<p>Economic welfare theory requires that people should be
compensated, not pay, for an environmentally degrading imposition on them (e.g. pollution,
biodiversity loss). However, this is generally not undertaken because people could ask large sums,
destroying the economic calculus, so economists prefer to restrict respondents replies to their
income (i.e. ability to pay) regardless of their own theoretical requirements for validity.
Besides being the incorrect measure, willingness-to-pay is not a democratic approach
seeking an opinion, as claimed by Dasgupta.
Despite their attempts to control respondents, CVM produces results
deemed unacceptable because people appear willing-to-pay too much or refuse to bid (i.e. protest).</p>
<p>Attempts have then been made to redesign the surveys to get the responses economists want and
hence they developed choice experiments, cited as a problem solving advance by Dasgupta (2021,
p. 304). Here respondents have restricted ability to protest, or violate the economists model of
how they should behave, and can only refuse to answer completely and fall into the ignored
nonrespondent category. Failing ‘success’ with survey design, collected data may be subject to
manipulation to get the desired values.</p>
<p>The welfare economics underlying social CBA assumes that all values can be reduced to individual
preferences as expressions of utility.</p>
<p>Refusing to make trade-offs is also a principled positon disallowed by
mainstream economics or treated as an anomaly.</p>
<p>The valuation question of social CBA, ‘what is your maximum willingness-to-pay for more/less
X?’, implicitly assumes there is no moral objection to the question itself.</p>
<p>More frogs do not equate to fewer tigers.
What then is ‘natural capital’?</p>
<p>Health (mortality/morbidity) as a capital investment is even worse. Producing money numbers
here requires the conjuring trick of talking about abstracted non-real people who are represented as
‘statistical lives’, under the VSL. For example, the results are used in transportation assessment to
decide upon road building programmes and the installation of safety equipment. However, the
public rejection of this approach is exposed when there is a train crash, people are killed and the
public discover the lack of safety equipment is due to the calculation that it cost more than the
expected fatalities times the VSL. Politicians rarely defend the numbers in such circumstances,
although their transport departments may continue to use them on a daily basis.</p>
<p><em>IPCC</em></p>
<p>A major example of the failings of VSL arose during the third assessment report of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Willingness-to-pay informed VSL, based on
Fankhauser (1995, p. 47), gave a range from $0.2–$16.0 million with an average of $3 million, and
$1.5 million adopted as the VSL for developed countries. Adjustment was made for income to
give ‘an arbitrary value of $300,000 for middle income and $100,000 for low income countries’.
The result was a factor of fifteen difference between VSL in high ($1.5 million) and low ($0.1
million) income countries. A storm raged when the IPCC chapter employing this approach
appeared (see Spash, 2002a, Chapter 7). Representatives from industrially developing nations,
led by India and China, refused to accept the report citing it as absurd, discriminatory, unethical,
technically inaccurate and anti the poor.</p>
<p>Shortly after the IPCC VSL controversy a prime example of commensurability problems arose
when CBA was applied to climate change by Nordhaus (1998a, 1998b). He claimed increased
moridity/mortality would be outweighed due to increased leisure opportunities by a factor of 30 to 10
in China and by 38 to 3 in the USA. An example Nordhaus was using at the time concerned claiming
that golfers may view global warming as a boon to year-round recreation. So, if we extend this
logic to global studies, more golfing days in Florida could compensate for dead people in China.
The commensuration of values in The Review is no different. Classes of capital are values,
equated and summed. Human capital is an aggregation of values so that, for example, more ‘education’
can compensate for increased risk of death. More than this, if education pays better financial
dividends than avoiding loss of life then, according to the economic accountants, the optimal world
should have more education and more death.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Discounting<a href="cost-benefit-analysis.html#discounting" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The mechanism chosen by Dasgupta to allocate natural resources between current and future
generations is a social discount rate (SDR). Alternatives, such as allocation on grounds of justice, rights
or needs, are therefore excluded,</p>
<p>While acknowledging the major ethical objections to discriminating against future
generations via discounting, Dasgupta (2021, Chapter 10) nevertheless chooses a positive discount
rate. He justifies this using the dubious argument that since returns on judiciously chosen
investments are positive (by assumption), fairness requires discriminating against future generations,
because otherwise the current generation would be unduly limited in consumption and condemned
to excessive poverty. This is a productivist logic based on assuming the future is always better-off.</p>
<p>Dasgupta follows standard neoclassical theory in treating future outcomes (flows of costs
and benefits) for public policy projects as subject to a social time preference (STP). The basic positon
here is to follow a formulae, called the Ramsey rule, that determines the SDR and STP as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[SDR = r + h g = STP\]</span></p>
<p>where g is annual per capita growth of consumption, η is the elasticity of marginal utility of
consumption and ρ is the utility discount rate, consisting of a component for pure time preference, δ, and, in
HM Treasury practice, a component for certain types of risk, L. Components of the formulae are so
uncertain that economists appeal to surveying themselves to get estimates, as if
this provided objective data.</p>
<p>In The Review commitment to an actual number is vague, and subject to
speculation as to economic growth and uncertainty. Elsewhere Dasgupta (2008) has argued that δ
could be zero, while, contrary to others, he argues for a much higher η in the range 2–3 or more.
The basic rate used by HM Treasury, in its Green Book, is 3.5%, 6 where δ = 0.5, L = 1 so
that ρ = 1.5 with the remainder consisting of consumption growth g = 2 and η = 1. If Dasgupta’s
argument for η is adopted then the STP would be between 5.5% and 7.5%, but he has argued favouring δ =
0 which would give 5.0–7.0%. This is extremely high.</p>
<p>For comparison consider how Nordhaus uses such rates to recommend catastrophic global
warming as economically rational. He states that ‘the cost-benefit optimum rises to over 3°C in
2100’ (Nordhaus, 2018, p. 452), and his Figure 5 shows a 2100 optimum around 3.6°C and rising,
because he recommends discounting the future at around 5% (Nordhaus, 2018, p. 455), writing off
any importance of future damages by 2100 (damages would weigh around 2% of their value today
meaning, for example, under VSL an action saving 2 people today at the cost of killing 97 people in
2100 would be a net gain, an optimal choice). This is neither unique to Nordhaus nor new, for
example, the economic working group of the IPCC third assessment used discount rates between
5% and 12%. A common claim, also made by Nordhaus, is that empirically
observable rates of return should be used. However, in actual economies the rate of return on risk
free investment has been zero or negative in real terms for years (Freeman et al., 2018, p. 16), but
discounting has persisted regardless of the theoretical justifications.</p>
<p>In fact there is no such thing as a singular rate in actual economies. The recognition that
differential rates for different projects is theoretically justified, and specifically for projects with
environmental impact, has led HM Treasury to discount at a lower rate (1.5%) for project impacts on health
and life. However, while recognized as formally correct Dasgupta rejects this
on the grounds, not of theory but, that it will be ‘cumbersome’ in practice and ‘lead inevitably to
errors’. Indeed he states it would be ‘unsafe’ because (now) the ‘social evaluator’ (or ‘citizen
investor’) cannot be trusted to get things right. Instead he recommends a single rate applied to all
projects. The reader might wonder at such pragmatism, for if all the problems of neoclassical
economics can be so easily dismissed on a whim as impractical and too cumbersome for his
social/citizen evaluator/investor this rather begs the question why he bothers us with his models,
theories and extensive mathematical detours and what other fallibilities his central
decisionmaker might suffer from.
That markets are not guides to intergenerational fairness, ethics or equity, would seem to bring
the whole approach into question. In his paper on discounting for climate change Dasgupta
concludes: ‘Intergenerational welfare economics raises more questions than it is able to
answer satisfactorily’. However, as usual, Dasgupta’s recognition of the problems has no impact
on his esteem for and continued use of neoclassical economics and, unsurprisingly, he recommends
discounting on this basis.</p>
